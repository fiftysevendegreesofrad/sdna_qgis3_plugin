# sDNA QGIS Plugin

This plugin allows you to use your installation of [sDNA](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/sdna) from within the [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) GIS software.

## Installation and usage

See the [sDNA User Manual](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/sdna/wp-content/downloads/documentation/manual/latest.html).

## Source

This repo is for the version supporting QGIS 3. This has been deployed to QGIS under the same plugin name as the QGIS 2 version. In other words, two separate source repos but a single item released to the QGIS plugins repo.

Running make_zip.bat creates a zip file for uploading to the QGIS plugins repo.
